      <description>Figure 1: PCB prototype  Mixed-signal computing for online optimization of power electronics systems Online optimization and optimal control techniques can substantially improve the efficiency, performance, and reliability of many power electronics systems. Some examples include model predictive direct torque control for motor drives, maximum power point tracking for renewable energy applications, and the optimal power flow problem for electric grids. Moreover, there are emerging trends towards increasingly advanced optimization techniques based on machine learning and artificial intelligence that can provide further benefit to many applications.</description>

      <description>   Figure 1: Photograph of a 40.68MHz PA develped for this project  Summary There are two main objectives centering around making the previously proposed technology viable for generating plasma The first goal is to develop the control technology for multilevel pulsing and arbitrary waveform envelope. The second goal is to improve and expand the mismatch load range of the amplifier.

      <description>Figure 1: Electrostatic potential contours under large-signal excitation at 1 MHz. (a) Deep buffer traps added at 0.98 eV. (b) Shallow buffer traps added at 0.5 eV.  Small- and Large-Signal Dynamic Output Capacitance and Energy Loss in GaN-on-Si Power HEMTs The origin of Coss and the energy dissipation due to output capacitance can be roughly separated into two types: resistive loss and capacitive hysteresis loss. The resistive losses are due to the resistance of gallium nitride (GaN) buffer layers and Si-substrate.</description>

      <title>High density power converters with Piezo-electric resonators</title>

      <description>Figure 1: Photograph of prototype piezoelectric resonator based dc-dc converter.  The performance of inductors at high frequencies and small sizes is one of the largest limiting factors in the continued miniaturization of dc-dc converters. Piezoelectric resonators can have a very high quality factor and provide an inductive impedance between their series and parallel resonant frequencies, making them a promising technology for further miniaturizing dc-dc converters. In this paper we analyze the impact of resonator parameters on the performance of the piezoelectric resonator based dc-dc converter, derive the optimal load impedance and efficiency limits, and analyze the impacts of varying conversion ratio and load impedance.</description>
