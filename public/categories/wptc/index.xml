      <description>This paper describes the design and implementation of a 1.7 kW wireless power transfer system that operates at 6.78 MHz and uses low-cost air-core coils. The demonstration achieves a dc-dc efficiency of 95.7% at 1.7 kW and maintains above 93% efficiency between 100 W and 1.7 kW.</description>

      <description>This paper presents a 1.3 kW resonant power amplifier using a Gallium Nitride (GaN) device at 13.56 MHz for wireless power transfer (WPT). The power amplifier driving the power transmitting coils is based on a Class Î¦ 2 inverter, a single switch topology with low switch voltage stress and fast transient response. This implementation utilizes a recently available GaN device in a low inductance package that is compatible with operation in the 10&amp;rsquo;s of MHz switching frequency. These power GaN switching devices have low gate resistance RG and low capacitance C GS which greatly reduces the power requirements of the gate drive circuitry. This paper shows experimental measurements of the inverter in a WPT application and characterization of the system performance over various distances and operating conditions.</description>
