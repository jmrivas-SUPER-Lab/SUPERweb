      <description>Figure 1: PCB prototype  Mixed-signal computing for online optimization of power electronics systems Online optimization and optimal control techniques can substantially improve the efficiency, performance, and reliability of many power electronics systems. Some examples include model predictive direct torque control for motor drives, maximum power point tracking for renewable energy applications, and the optimal power flow problem for electric grids. Moreover, there are emerging trends towards increasingly advanced optimization techniques based on machine learning and artificial intelligence that can provide further benefit to many applications.</description>
