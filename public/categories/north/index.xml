      <description>Doctoral Dissertation   On the design and optimization of RF power amplifiers using wide bandgap devices      Presented March 2021 Manuscript available here.  Summary     Compact radio-frequency (RF) power amplifiers are essential building blocks in various applications, including radio transmission, medical imaging, wireless power transfer, industrial plasma generation, and micro-satellite propulsion. Over the past decades, new wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor devices, particularly gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC), were successfully commercialized.</description>

      <description>In this paper, we present an alternative power modulation method to create a high-efficiency high-speed RF amplifier system. This control technique utilizes two mechanisms, modular on/off and phase-shifting. In modular on/off, a different number of sub-circuits are turned “on” or “off” to crudely adjust the output power.</description>
