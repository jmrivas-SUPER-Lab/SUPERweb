      <description>Figure 1: Photograph of prototype piezoelectric resonator based dc-dc converter.  The performance of inductors at high frequencies and small sizes is one of the largest limiting factors in the continued miniaturization of dc-dc converters. Piezoelectric resonators can have a very high quality factor and provide an inductive impedance between their series and parallel resonant frequencies, making them a promising technology for further miniaturizing dc-dc converters. In this paper we analyze the impact of resonator parameters on the performance of the piezoelectric resonator based dc-dc converter, derive the optimal load impedance and efficiency limits, and analyze the impacts of varying conversion ratio and load impedance.</description>
