      <description>Doctoral Dissertation   * Compact high frequency power conversion for high voltage applications *      Presented in 2018 Manuscript available here.  Summary     Performance of high-voltage power converters has lagged their low-voltage counterparts on many metrics including power density, efficiency, transient response, and cost. This research presents newly developed circuit techniques and design strategies that allow high-voltage power supplies to be many times smaller and more efficient than the traditional high-voltage supplies on the market today.</description>

      <description>This paper presents the design and implementation of a high-frequency/very high frequency (VHF) multiresonant gate drive circuit. The proposed circuit can reduce the long start-up time required in a self-oscillating resonant gate drive circuit and utilize the fast transient capability of VHF converters better. We demonstrate a prototype resonant gate driver, which reduces up to 60% of the gate-driving power in a 20-MHz 32-W Class-E power amplifier using a Si MOSFET.</description>

      <description>Progress in satellite technologies is ongoing and eventually finds applications back on Earth. Electric propulsion systems have been proven effective on large scale satellites (NASA DAWN) with better propellant efficiency than chemical or cold gas propulsion, and if miniaturized can be promising for long term operation of nano-satellites (e.g., CubeSats) in low Earth orbit or in deep space (NASA MarCO). Here we present a compact and efficient switched mode dc-RF power inverter integrated with an electro-thermal plasma micro-thruster for nano-satellite (e.g., Cubesats) propulsion. The integrated system can serve as side panels and structural support of CubeSats, saving precious on-board volume for propellant and/or payloads.</description>

      <description>We report losses from charging and discharging the parasitic output capacitor, COSS , in Gallium Nitride (GaN) power devices with voltage ratings over 600 VDS. These losses are of particular importance in soft-switched circuits used at MHz switching frequencies, where the output capacitance of the device is charged and discharged once per switching cycle during the device off-time.</description>

      <guid>/publication/tpels-wide-input-step-down-pfc-variable-freq_gu/</guid>
      <description>This paper demonstrates a two-stage implementation of a step-down power factor preregulator design that achieves a high efficiency across the entire universal input voltage range (85-265 V rms ) for an offline power supply application. The proposed circuit allows MOSFETs with lower voltage ratings and better conduction/switching characteristics to be used in both converter stages. A scaling law of power losses versus breakdown voltage requirement for boost circuit under the condition of the same output power is presented. Experimental results demonstrated a flatter high efficiency performance across a wide input range.</description>

      <description>In this paper, we construct three Class-Î¦ 2 resonant converters with GaN HEMT power devices, 1 kW output power, and switching frequencies of 10 MHz, 30 MHz, and 54.24 MHz. The GaN HEMTs in these converters exhibit losses, approximated thermally, that are significantly higher (up to an order of magnitude) than those predicted by simulation. To investigate, we use a Sawyer-Tower circuit to evaluate the losses in the output capacitance, C OSS , of GaN devices from each manufacturer with commercially-available power devices with voltage ratings over 600 VDS .</description>

      <title>Design of very-high-frequency synchronous resonant DC-DC converter for variable load operation</title>

      <guid>/publication/ecce-syncrec-variable-load_gu/</guid>
      <description>This paper proposes a simple solution to implement synchronous rectification for resonant dc-dc power converters operating in the Very-High-Frequency (VHF) range, by using a symmetric bandpass matching network between the inverter and rectifier. A bandpass matching network maintains a close-to-zero phase shift between the inverter and rectifier voltage, enabling the synchronous switch to be driven by the same clock signal as the inverter switch.</description>

      <description>TThis paper presents a compact RF power inverter implemented with a PCB multi-resonant input filter for driving an electrothermal plasma micro-thruster, mini Pocket Rocket 3.0 (miniPR 3.0). This miniPR 3.0 and its driving electronics are part of an investigation seeking to add micro propulsion systems to low cost CubeSats. The proposed RF power inverter and multi-resonant input filter use only air core inductors. All inductors are toroidal and formed by PCB traces and vias allowing a planar and compact design. The PCB structure serves as structural support to save space and volume for propulsion propellant and other payloads.</description>

      <description>This paper presents the design and implementation of a Very-High-Frequency (VHF) multi-resonant gate drive circuit. The design procedure is greatly simplified compared with some VHF self-oscillating multi-resonant gate drivers presented in previous works. The proposed circuit has the potential to reduce long start-up time required in a self-oscillating resonant gate drive circuit and to better utilize fast transient capability of VHF converters. A prototype resonant gate driver is demonstrated and able to reduce 60 % of the gate driving loss of a 20 MHz 32 W Class-E power amplifier with Si MOSFET.</description>

      <title>A unified model for high-power, air-core toroidal PCB inductors</title>

      <description>We present the first unified electrical model for high-power, air-core toroidal inductors implemented as PCB traces, which includes closed-form calculations for the lumped capacitance, resistance, and inductance of the structure. In this regime, the self-resonant frequency (SRF) of the inductor may be of the same order of magnitude as the circuit operating frequency, so the capacitance must be carefully modeled and tightly controlled.</description>

      <description>This paper demonstrates a two-stage implementation of a power factor preregulator design in which the energy buffer capacitor is placed at the output of the converter. In this implementation, a resonant LLC converter supplies power to a boost converter operating in continuous conduction mode. Here, a variable frequency (VFX) technique is used in the resonant LLC converter stage to achieve a lower variation in the overall efficiency across the universal input voltage range (85 - 265V rms ).</description>

      <description>Electroporation is a technique that uses high pulsed electric fields to create pores in biological cell walls for medical, liquid sterilization and other applications. Many systems use mono-polar pulses for simplicity but electro-migration can limit electrode life. The following paper demonstrates a resonant circuit design for creating high voltage bi-polar dc pulses using a simple control strategy. The circuit topology consists of two Radio Frequency (RF) amplifiers each coupled to a multi-level resonant rectifier employing capacitive isolation and operating at 15 MHz. The RF signals generated by the amplifiers themselves are used to control the pulse duration and output polarity. Any sequence of positive and negative pulse trains can be generated between several Î¼s through dc. This paper presents a proof of concept design providing 800 V positive and negative pulses into a resistive load.</description>

      <description>This paper demonstrates a high efficiency, high power density, and fast transient response dc-dc converter design capable of providing a high-voltage isolated output from a low-voltage input. Specifically, we demonstrate two 100 W, 2000 Vdc proof of concept prototype dc-dc converters operating at a switching frequency of 27.12 MHz with input voltages of 40 V and 100 V respectively. Capacitive isolation provides an efficient means of allowing for multiple rectified outputs to be combined serially without exceeding semi-conductor device limits. Further, it can provide a more efficient means of impedance matching at frequencies of 10s of MHz than traditional methods such as passive matching networks or transformers by the reduction of or elimination of those stages altogether.</description>

      <description>This paper presents the design and implementation of a 27.12 MHz, 320 W, 170 V to 28 V dc-dc resonant power converter with resonant inductors and capacitors embedded into the Printed Circuit Board (PCB). Operating at 27.12 MHz allows for small value and size resonant passive components to be implemented using traces on or within a PCB. A prototype dc-dc converter was built to verify the concept and it reaches an efficiency of 73.6%. A simulated loss analysis is also presented.</description>

      <description>This paper demonstrates a dc-dc converter that combines resonant rectifiers in a way to achieve impedance matching and significant voltage gains without the need for a high quality factor (Q) impedance matching network. Multiple stages are stacked in a way that allows for higher output voltages without suffering efficiency penalties common to traditional serial type high-voltage converter topologies such as the Crockroft-Walton Multiplier. Application of this design results in an isolated resonant dc-dc converter design that promises high efficiency, fast transient response, and high power density while providing a high-voltage isolated output from a lower-voltage input.</description>

      <description>Resonant dc-dc converter regularly use Schottky diodes for high frequency rectification. Si Schottky diodes have relatively low voltage ratings and present reverse-recovery type losses when driven hard enough. SiC Schottky diodes can operate at high frequencies, but incur higher conduction losses. This paper presents a bidirectional dc-dc resonant converter having two ground referenced switches. The prototype converter delivers 400 W between a source of 170 V and a load of 50 V while delivering 250 W in the opposite direction. The converter presented herein can potentially be used in applications such as wireless power transfer, fuel cell and battery applications, bus converters, etc.</description>

      <description>This paper presents the design, modeling, and characterization of 3-D-printed air-core inductors for high-frequency power electronics circuits. The use of 3-D modeling techniques to make passive components extends the design flexibility and addresses some of the fabrication limitations of traditional processes. In this paper, we present several examples of air-core inductors realized using 3-D printing and casting/plating techniques to give an idea of the geometries that are possible to design. Toward this goal, we present a 70-W prototype 27.12-MHz resonant inverter that incorporates some of the 3-D-printed components developed for this paper.</description>
