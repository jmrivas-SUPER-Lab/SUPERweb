      <title>Compact Fast-Switching DC and Resonant RF Drivers for a Dual-Mode Imaging and HIFU 2D CMUT Array</title>

      <description>We developed previously a 2D CMUT array with capability to both do imaging and generate HIFU for ablation of targeted tissues without collateral damage. This new technology allows a more compact HIFU system, when compared to conventional systems composed of HIFU transducers made of PZT, cooling systems for PZT and additional imaging guidance systems. In this paper we present new dc and RF power electronics that drive our 2D CMUT array. The new electronics are significantly more compact and capable of fast-switching between imaging and HIFU mode.</description>

      <title>High-Frequency Bidirectional Resonant Converter for High Conversion Ratio and Variable Load Operation</title>

      <description>This article proposes an HF/very HF (VHF) resonant converter structure in which the rectifier and the inverter switches can be driven with the same gate signal. The presented structure enables efficient bidirectional power delivery in the HF/VHF range for applications that require a large voltage conversion ratio. A 64-MHz, 12-W, 36-12-V prototype converter verifies the operation of the structure. This article further explores an interleaved architecture of the same circuit to improve efficiency and transient performance.</description>

      <title>Low mass RF power inverter for cubesat plasma thruster using 3D printed inductors</title>

      <description>This paper presents the design of a low mass RF power inverter at moderate to high power levels (e.g. tens of watts and above) for weight critical applications such as cubesat plasma thrusters. Our approach for mass reduction includes resonant switching operation at tens of MHz, and the 3D printing of light-weight scaffolds that form air core inductors after plating with a thin layer of copper. Specifically, we present a 14.2 MHz 50 W resonant DC-RF power inverter implemented with 3D printed and plated air core toroidal inductors. The inverter achieves 90% electrical efficiency when operated on a 50 Î© resistive load at an input voltage of 50 V.</description>
