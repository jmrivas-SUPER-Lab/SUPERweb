      <description>An apparatus including direct-current (DC)-alternating-current (AC) inverter circuitry, first and second circuits, and output circuitry. The DC-AC inverter circuitry inverts a DC input signal corresponding to an input voltage to an AC signal. The first circuit and second circuits respectively include inductive isolation circuits driven in response to power from the at least one AC signal, and rectifier circuits that responds to the inductive isolation circuits by outputting first and second rectified signals, where at least one of the first and second rectifier circuits characterized as being limited by a voltage breakdown rating. The output circuitry provides a DC output voltage signal and to cascade a plurality of signals, including the first and second rectified signals, to provide a voltage source that is dependent on the first and second rectified signals and greater than voltage breakdown rating.</description>

      <title>Low-Ripple High-Voltage DC Generation Using a Serially Segmented Multiphase Voltage Multiplier</title>

      <description>This paper presents a voltage multiplier topology that is suitable for a low-ripple high-voltage dc generation. The topology has a number of voltage multipliers connected in series and driven at different phases. Compared to a single-phase multiplier, an n-phase voltage multiplier has an output ripple that is smaller by n times. We demonstrate the ripple reduction of the proposed topology using a 6 V-to-800 V power supply with a 16-stage four-phase bipolar voltage multiplier. The output ripple frequency is eight times the converter&amp;rsquo;s switching frequency and the ripple amplitude is significantly smaller than the conventional single-phase voltage multiplier</description>

      <title>A Compact 45 V-to-54 kV Modular DC-DC Converter</title>

      <description>This paper presents the design of a compact 45 V-to-54 kV dc-dc converter for high-energy beam applications with the focus on X-ray generation. We describe key design choices for a high power density including a modular structure, high-frequency switching, planar transformers and Dickson topology. High-voltage insulation and thermal management are also described in detail. The experimental data with with a 5 kV single module and a 10-module 54 kV converter indicate that the proposed structure can generate high dc voltage while achieving a several times higher power density compared to commercial high-voltage power supplies.</description>

      <title>60 V-to-35 kV input-parallel output-series DC-DC converter using multi-level class-DE rectifiers</title>

      <description>This paper presents a high-voltage dc-dc converter that includes inductively-isolated rectifiers. Previous work on multi-stage class-DE rectifiers only included capacitive dc isolation, limiting the output voltage to twice of the capacitor voltage rating. By adding an air-core transformer before the rectifier for inductive isolation, the maximum output voltage can be twice the breakdown voltage of the insulation between the transformer&amp;rsquo;s primary and secondary windings, thus allowing the implementation of a small, lightweight, and fast transient high-voltage dc-dc converter. We experimentally demonstrate a multi-modular converter design with 60 V input voltage and 35 kV output voltage with 73 % efficiency.</description>

      <title>Resonant bi-polar DC pulse power supply for electroporation applications</title>

      <description>Electroporation is a technique that uses high pulsed electric fields to create pores in biological cell walls for medical, liquid sterilization and other applications. Many systems use mono-polar pulses for simplicity but electro-migration can limit electrode life. The following paper demonstrates a resonant circuit design for creating high voltage bi-polar dc pulses using a simple control strategy. The circuit topology consists of two Radio Frequency (RF) amplifiers each coupled to a multi-level resonant rectifier employing capacitive isolation and operating at 15 MHz. The RF signals generated by the amplifiers themselves are used to control the pulse duration and output polarity. Any sequence of positive and negative pulse trains can be generated between several Î¼s through dc. This paper presents a proof of concept design providing 800 V positive and negative pulses into a resistive load.</description>

      <title>27.12 MHz isolated high voltage gain multi-level resonant DC-DC converter</title>

      <description>This paper demonstrates a high efficiency, high power density, and fast transient response dc-dc converter design capable of providing a high-voltage isolated output from a low-voltage input. Specifically, we demonstrate two 100 W, 2000 Vdc proof of concept prototype dc-dc converters operating at a switching frequency of 27.12 MHz with input voltages of 40 V and 100 V respectively. Capacitive isolation provides an efficient means of allowing for multiple rectified outputs to be combined serially without exceeding semi-conductor device limits. Further, it can provide a more efficient means of impedance matching at frequencies of 10s of MHz than traditional methods such as passive matching networks or transformers by the reduction of or elimination of those stages altogether.</description>

      <description>This paper demonstrates a dc-dc converter that combines resonant rectifiers in a way to achieve impedance matching and significant voltage gains without the need for a high quality factor (Q) impedance matching network. Multiple stages are stacked in a way that allows for higher output voltages without suffering efficiency penalties common to traditional serial type high-voltage converter topologies such as the Crockroft-Walton Multiplier. Application of this design results in an isolated resonant dc-dc converter design that promises high efficiency, fast transient response, and high power density while providing a high-voltage isolated output from a lower-voltage input.</description>

      <title>Performance evaluation of diodes in 27.12 MHz Class-D resonant rectifiers under high voltage and high slew rate conditions</title>
      <link>/publication/compel-coss-diodes_raymond/</link>

      <description>This paper provides a performance review of select diodes for use in high frequency resonant rectifiers at modest power levels. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several leading edge diodes for use in a 27.12 MHz Class-D type rectifier for output voltages from 170 V to 1000 V dc, and corresponding power levels between 8.5 W and 100 W. The authors suspect these losses are due in part to the high equation experienced by the Silicon Carbide (SiC) Schottky diodes used in that design.</description>

      <description>This paper presents the design and implementation of a high frequency switching power converter with a large voltage gain and air core inductors. Specifically, we demonstrate a 40 W, 30 V to 300 V dc-dc converter switching at 27.12 MHz.We evaluate and compare two rectifier topologies with lower voltage stress than the class E rectifiers described in [2], to get large voltage ratios. Unique to this design is the ability to provide short bursts of high voltage while promising excellent performance and high power density.</description>
