      <description>We present a hybrid analog/digital computing circuit to solve a selective harmonic minimization problem. The approach leverages favorable attributes of digital and analog controllers to yield a fast and scalable optimization solver. We present a specific realization of the computing circuit that solves for eight independent switching angles for a quarter-wave symmetric PWM driven two-level single-phase inverter. Seven undesired harmonics are minimized while retaining control over modulation index. The proposed computing circuit is verified with simulations and a PCB hardware implementation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed circuit can converge to the optimal solution in less than 5 ms, which is substantially faster than existing methods and facilitates real-time implementation. Moreover, the steady-state power consumption of the PCB implementation is approximately 750 mW, which is also significantly lower than published methods for comparable applications.</description>
