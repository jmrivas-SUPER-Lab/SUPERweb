    </header>
      
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">MHz-frequency inductive wireless power transfer holds the promise of increased power density and high- efficiency wireless power transfer. Unfortunately, due to high- frequency losses in wide-bandgap semiconductors and low-Q high-frequency coil designs, these systems are universally less efficient, on a dc-dc basis, than wireless power systems operating at conventional frequency regimes. This letter describes the design considerations for inductive wireless power transfer systems operating at 6.78 MHz. Particularly, we present the optimal compensation strategy for parallel compensated coils, which is a topic less frequently discussed in literature than the series compensated coils. With a novel high-frequency resonant amplifier topology, a high-Q self-resonant coil structure, and an optimal design strategy, we demonstrate a 6.78 MHz, 300 W wireless power transfer system that achieves 95 % dc-dc efficiency.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy mb4">We design and build a DC-DC wireless power system for electric vehicles charging at 6.78 MHz. With a gap of 34 cm, the air-core system can transfer up to 1 kW with 82% efficiency. It can operate continuously without failure even when the gap varies from 26 to 38 cm, and though the output power changes with distance, the efficiency does not vary appreciably. Due to the high operating frequency, the transfer coils are lightweight, inexpensive, and mechanically robust, even with a gap much larger than in previous literature. The systems low cost and resilience across coupling makes it amenable to mass deployment in commercial systems.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy mb4">Dynamic on-resistance (dRon), where the on-resistance immediately after turn-on is higher than the DC resistance, increases the conduction losses in power converters with gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs). There exist no direct dR on measurements in the literature above 1 MHz, leaving designers unable to predict conduction losses in emerging multi-MHz applications. We address this literature gap by collecting the first on-state voltage dR on measurements at multi-MHz frequencies, with a focus on the zero-voltage-switching conditions that are predominantly employed at high frequency. On the selected commercially-available HEMT with a breakdown voltage below 200 V, the dynamic contribution asymptotes above ≈ 2 MHz, a finding predicted by the slow time constants of the traps that cause dR on</p>

Our resonant tanks achieve diameter-normalized quality factors (Q d ) that are 25%-70% better than the state of the art for air-core coils at 6.78 MHz (Q d = 73 cm -1 ) and 13.56 MHz (102), and we show significant improvements at the 27.12 MHz (123) and 40.68 MHz (137) ISM bands.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy mb4">Here, we use a back-gate bias between the source and Si substrate to investigate the capacitance characteristics of commercially-available GaN HEMTs. The small-signal capacitance is reduced significantly - up to 2 × for a 650 V HEMT and 4× for a 100 V HEMT - indicating that the drain-substrate capacitance is a significant portion of the total output capacitance. Our findings indicate that the buffer-substrate stack is likely an important driver of Coss losses in GaN-on-Si HEMTs, and its optimization must be considered to efficiently use GaN HEMTs at high-frequencies. Traditional C oss measurements with the DC bias swept in both directions may give an indication of the relative level of trapping in this stack.</p>

      <p class="lh-copy mb4">This paper presents a method to predict the overvoltage failure rate of diodes connected in series under high-frequency reverse bias. Conventional approaches use balancing capacitors to ensure the reliability of series-connected diodes at high frequency. Instead, we investigate the viability of achieving voltage balance between devices solely by the match between their junction capacitances. Serializing diodes without extra balancing components increases the blocking voltage and decreases the capacitance, allowing high-voltage conversion at high frequencies for applications such as X-ray. We measure statistical properties of junction capacitances to estimate the reverse voltage limit of 2, 3, and 4 diodes in series. The predicted failure rate shows a good agreement with experimental results.</p>

The measured COSS losses in SiC MOSFETs do not increase with dV/dt at frequencies from 1-35 MHz and applied voltages up to 900 V.

      <p class="lh-copy mb4">Among HF/VHF rectifiers, SiC Schottky diodes exhibit larger losses compared to those captured in simulation, with additional off-state losses stemming from energy dissipation during the charging and discharging of the CJ. Because these losses are not included in manufacturer simulation models nor have they been well-studied for SiC Schottky diodes, we experimentally measured them using the Sawyer-Tower circuit and compared the losses across manufacturer, current rating, generation, voltage rating, and packaging. Furthermore, we analyzed the performances of these devices on a class-DE rectifier and compared their power dissipation from the simulation and experimental measurements.</p>

    </header>
      
      <p class="lh-copy mb4">We report losses from charging and discharging the parasitic output capacitor, COSS , in Gallium Nitride (GaN) power devices with voltage ratings over 600 VDS. These losses are of particular importance in soft-switched circuits used at MHz switching frequencies, where the output capacitance of the device is charged and discharged once per switching cycle during the device off-time.</p>
