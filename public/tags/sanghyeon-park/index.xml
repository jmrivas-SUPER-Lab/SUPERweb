      <description>In this letter, we motivate the need for application-specific power electronics solutions for electroadhesive perching, develop a useful figure of merit (the “specific voltage”) for comparing and guiding efforts, and walk through the design methodology of a system implementation. We conclude by showing that this high voltage power supply enables, for the first time in the literature, tetherless electroadhesive perching of a commercial micro quadrotor.</description>

      <title>Optimized Design of Multi-MHz Frequency Isolated Auxiliary Power Supply for Gate Drivers in Medium-Voltage Converters</title>

      <description>This article presents the design and optimization of a suitable topology for an isolated dc–dc auxiliary power supply with high isolation voltage and low coupling capacitance. The converter consists of a GaN HEMT inverter operating at 6.78 MHz, an LCC resonance tank, and a class-E low dv/dt rectifier.</description>

      <description>This paper presents a voltage multiplier topology that is a hybrid between a Cockcroft-Walton multiplier and a Dickson charge pump. The Cockcroft-Walton structure exhibits significant output voltage drop under load as the number of multiplier stage increases.</description>

      <title>Duty Cycle and Frequency Modulations in Class-E DC–DC Converters for a Wide Range of Input and Output Voltages</title>

      <description>We present an operation scheme for a dc-dc converter consisting of a class-E inverter and a class-E rectifier to always achieve zero-voltage zero-dv/dt switching at a wide range of input and output voltages. Experiments demonstrate the prototype converter maintaining the desired soft-switching condition under 80-200-V input voltage and 5-20-V output voltage variations. In an additional prototype, we implemented a similar design with synchronous rectification that achieves a peak efficiency of 92.3% at an input voltage of 80 V, an output voltage of 12 V, and an output power of 26.9 W.</description>

      <title>COSS Losses in 600 V GaN Power Semiconductors in Soft-Switched, High- and Very-High-Frequency Power Converters</title>

      <description>We report losses from charging and discharging the parasitic output capacitor, COSS , in Gallium Nitride (GaN) power devices with voltage ratings over 600 VDS. These losses are of particular importance in soft-switched circuits used at MHz switching frequencies, where the output capacitance of the device is charged and discharged once per switching cycle during the device off-time.</description>

      <title>Design of a Class-DE Rectifier with Shunt Inductance and Nonlinear Capacitance for High-Voltage Conversion</title>
      <link>/publication/tpels-de-rectifier-hv_park/</link>

      <guid>/publication/tpels-de-rectifier-hv_park/</guid>
      <description>This paper presents a design method for a resonant class-DE rectifier with a shunt inductance input network. In this paper, we propose a design procedure that begins with universal design curves that are applicable regardless of the capacitance nonlinearity. This is followed by parameter selection and a convergence check to ensure the rectifier operates at the desired output voltage. Based on the outlined procedure, we design and experimentally verify a 27-MHz 350-V current-driven rectifier, a 25-MHz 500-V voltage-driven rectifier, and a 27.12-MHz 2-kV four-stage rectifier, all of which the resonant capacitor is nonlinear and the input impedance is resistive at the switching frequency.</description>
