      <title>Active Power Device Selection in High- and Very-High-Frequency Power Converters</title>

      <description>This paper aims to provide a road map for selecting power devices in soft-switched, megahertz (MHz) frequency power converters. Minimizing $C_{OSS}$ losses, which occur when charging and discharging the parasitic output capacitor of power semiconductors, is critical to efficient operation. These losses are excluded from manufacturer-provided information, and measurements are either sparse or not reported at all in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Duty Cycle and Frequency Modulations in Class-E DCâ€“DC Converters for a Wide Range of Input and Output Voltages</title>

      <description>We present an operation scheme for a dc-dc converter consisting of a class-E inverter and a class-E rectifier to always achieve zero-voltage zero-dv/dt switching at a wide range of input and output voltages. Experiments demonstrate the prototype converter maintaining the desired soft-switching condition under 80-200-V input voltage and 5-20-V output voltage variations. In an additional prototype, we implemented a similar design with synchronous rectification that achieves a peak efficiency of 92.3% at an input voltage of 80 V, an output voltage of 12 V, and an output power of 26.9 W.</description>

      <title>A Wide-Input-Range High-Efficiency Step-Down Power Factor Correction Converter Using a Variable Frequency Multiplier Technique,</title>

      <description>This paper demonstrates a two-stage implementation of a step-down power factor preregulator design that achieves a high efficiency across the entire universal input voltage range (85-265 V rms ) for an offline power supply application. The proposed circuit allows MOSFETs with lower voltage ratings and better conduction/switching characteristics to be used in both converter stages. A scaling law of power losses versus breakdown voltage requirement for boost circuit under the condition of the same output power is presented. Experimental results demonstrated a flatter high efficiency performance across a wide input range.</description>
