      <description>Doctoral Dissertation   High-frequency, high-power resonant converter with wide bandgap devices for wireless power transfer systems      Presented in 2018 Manuscript availabe here.  Summary     As demand for electric vehicles (EVs) grows, wireless power transfer (WPT) technology becomes beneficial by removing the need for manual intervention to charge EV batteries. These high-power applications require power electronics systems that not only efficiently deliver sufficient power, but are also small enough to be embedded in the EV.</description>

      <title>Designing a 40.68 MHz power-combining resonant inverter with eGaN FETs for plasma generation</title>

      <description>This paper presents the design of a 40.68 MHz, 1.2 kW power-combining resonant inverter using eGaN FETs for plasma generation. To provide high power at 40.68 MHz switching frequency, a class Φ2 inverter topology with wide band gap (WBG) devices such as eGaN FETs was selected. The proposed inverter topology reduces the power loss in each switching device, which can decrease the size of the heat sink. This study demonstrates that power-combining resonant inverters using eGaN FETs can increase efficiency and power density while operating at 40.68 MHz.</description>

      <description>This paper presents an impedance compression network (ICN) design in a wireless power transfer (WPT) system to compensate for distance or alignment variations between coils. In order to reduce coil impedance variation, we propose an ICN that compresses variations in coil impedance.</description>

      <description>This letter presents a high-power resonant inverter using an enhancement mode gallium nitride (eGaN) device with magnetic resonant coupling (MRC) coils at 13.56 MHz for wireless power transfer (WPT). The power inverter driving the transmitting coils is based on a class Φ2 inverter, a single-switch topology with low switch-voltage stress, and fast transient response.</description>
