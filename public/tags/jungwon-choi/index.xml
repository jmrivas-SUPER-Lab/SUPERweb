      <description>Doctoral Dissertation   High-frequency, high-power resonant converter with wide bandgap devices for wireless power transfer systems      Presented in 2018 Manuscript availabe here.  Summary     As demand for electric vehicles (EVs) grows, wireless power transfer (WPT) technology becomes beneficial by removing the need for manual intervention to charge EV batteries. These high-power applications require power electronics systems that not only efficiently deliver sufficient power, but are also small enough to be embedded in the EV.</description>

      <description>This paper presents the design of a 40.68 MHz, 1.2 kW power-combining resonant inverter using eGaN FETs for plasma generation. To provide high power at 40.68 MHz switching frequency, a class Φ2 inverter topology with wide band gap (WBG) devices such as eGaN FETs was selected. The proposed inverter topology reduces the power loss in each switching device, which can decrease the size of the heat sink. This study demonstrates that power-combining resonant inverters using eGaN FETs can increase efficiency and power density while operating at 40.68 MHz.</description>

      <description>This paper presents the design and implementation of a high-frequency resonant converter with an impedance compression network (ICN) to correct horizontal alignment variations between coils in a wireless power transfer (WPT) system. In order to mitigate variations in coil impedance, we propose an ICN that simultaneously compresses magnitude and phase changes of coil impedance.</description>

      <description>This paper presents the design and implementation of an impedance compression network (ICN) to correct distance variation or misalignment between coils in wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. Magnetic resonant coupling (MRC) coils provide high efficiency for charging mid-range WPT applications. However, a distance variation or misalignment between coils causes a coil-impedance change and significantly affects performances of WPT systems. In order to mitigate a coil-impedance variation, we propose an ICN simultaneously compressing changes in magnitude and phase of impedance. The ICN consists of a resistance compression network (RCN) and phase compression network (PCN). While the RCN effectively compresses the variation in the magnitude of impedance by using one pair consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, the PCN is designed using a Smith chart to reduce a phase variation.</description>

      <title>Comparison of SiC and eGaN devices in a 6.78 MHz 2.2 kW resonant inverter for wireless power transfer</title>

      <description>This paper presents a performance comparison of two wide band gap (WBG) devices, a silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET and an enhancement mode gallium nitride (eGaN) FET in a resonant inverter operating at 6.78 MHz for wireless power transfer (WPT) applications. While SiC MOSFETs provide high breakdown voltage and good thermal characteristics, eGaN FETs can reduce gate losses due to small gate resistance and input capacitance. In this work, we compare a 1200 V SiC MOSFET in a single-ended class Φ 2 inverter to two 650 V eGaN FETs in a push-pull class Φ 2 inverter.</description>

      <description>This paper demonstrates the performance of a 900 V silicon carbide (SiC) power MOSFET operating at 13.56 MHz in a 2 kW resonant inverter targeted for wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. Operating at multi-MHz switching frequency leads to smaller passive components and has the potential to improve power density and reduce weight for weight-sensitive applications. In this work, we study and evaluate the electrical characteristics of a 900 V, 7L D2PAK SiC MOSFET and demonstrate the design of a 2 kW single-ended resonant inverter operating at 13.56 MHz.</description>

      <description>This paper presents a 1.3 kW resonant power amplifier using a Gallium Nitride (GaN) device at 13.56 MHz for wireless power transfer (WPT). The power amplifier driving the power transmitting coils is based on a Class Φ 2 inverter, a single switch topology with low switch voltage stress and fast transient response. This implementation utilizes a recently available GaN device in a low inductance package that is compatible with operation in the 10&amp;rsquo;s of MHz switching frequency. These power GaN switching devices have low gate resistance RG and low capacitance C GS which greatly reduces the power requirements of the gate drive circuitry. This paper shows experimental measurements of the inverter in a WPT application and characterization of the system performance over various distances and operating conditions.</description>
