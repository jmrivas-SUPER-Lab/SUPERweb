      <description>Class E power amplifiers are widely used in high- frequency applications due to their simplicity and use of only one ground-referenced switch. However, Class E power amplifiers are usually tuned to operate at a fixed frequency due to their resonant nature. Extending the bandwidth of these switch-mode power amplifiers is beneficial in many applications, such as plasma generators and wireless power transfer systems. In this paper, we present a 1 kW wideband Class E power amplifier using Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs that achieves 93% efficiency at 13.56 MHz with a bandwidth of 1 MHz.</description>
