      <description>This paper proposes a simple solution to implement synchronous rectification for resonant dc-dc power converters operating in the Very-High-Frequency (VHF) range, by using a symmetric bandpass matching network between the inverter and rectifier. A bandpass matching network maintains a close-to-zero phase shift between the inverter and rectifier voltage, enabling the synchronous switch to be driven by the same clock signal as the inverter switch.</description>

      <title>Inductance cancellation in RF resonant power converters</title>

      <description>Parasitic inductance cancellation is employed in order to operate a resonant power inverter at 27.12 MHz using a TO-220 through-hole package.The elimination of parasitic inductances allows for system cost reduction, increased power handling, and/or relaxation of PCB layout constraints. The inductance cancellation technique is demonstrated through two prototypes (based upon the same silicon MOSFET die) providing 60 W of RF power to a 50 Î© load from a 48 V DC input.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a 900 V SiC MOSFET in a 13.56 MHz 2 kW resonant inverter for wireless power transfer</title>

      <description>This paper demonstrates the performance of a 900 V silicon carbide (SiC) power MOSFET operating at 13.56 MHz in a 2 kW resonant inverter targeted for wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. Operating at multi-MHz switching frequency leads to smaller passive components and has the potential to improve power density and reduce weight for weight-sensitive applications. In this work, we study and evaluate the electrical characteristics of a 900 V, 7L D2PAK SiC MOSFET and demonstrate the design of a 2 kW single-ended resonant inverter operating at 13.56 MHz.</description>
