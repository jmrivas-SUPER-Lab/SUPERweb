      <description>This paper presents a voltage multiplier topology that is suitable for a low-ripple high-voltage dc generation. The topology has a number of voltage multipliers connected in series and driven at different phases. Compared to a single-phase multiplier, an n-phase voltage multiplier has an output ripple that is smaller by n times. We demonstrate the ripple reduction of the proposed topology using a 6 V-to-800 V power supply with a 16-stage four-phase bipolar voltage multiplier. The output ripple frequency is eight times the converter&amp;rsquo;s switching frequency and the ripple amplitude is significantly smaller than the conventional single-phase voltage multiplier</description>

      <title>Multiphase GaN Class-D Resonant Amplifier for High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound</title>

      <description>Focused ultrasound treats tissue deep in the body without damaging surrounding structures. Driven by large-amplitude RF electrical signals, ultrasonic transducers can generate large pressure acoustic wave. Wide-bandgap semiconductors, e.g., Gallium Nitride (GaN), greatly simplify the design and reduce the requisite size and weight of RF amplifiers, and so improves the portability of focused ultrasound device. Here, we demonstrate a compact 8-phase 5 MHz Class-D resonant amplifier for a focused ultrasound cancer therapy application.</description>
