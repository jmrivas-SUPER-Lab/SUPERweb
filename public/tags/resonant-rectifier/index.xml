      <description>This paper presents a design methodology for the tuning of a class-D half-wave resonant rectifier with a parallel LC resonant tank input network. We propose a systematic design procedure that begins with universal design curves applicable to any rectifier design of this topology. This is followed by parameter selection and a convergence check that ensures the rectifier operates with the desired output voltage. Experimental results confirm the validity of the design method for both linear and nonlinear resonant capacitances. Based on the outlined procedure, a 25 MHz 500 V rectifier with resistive input impedance is designed and experimentally verified.</description>

      <description>This paper provides a performance review of select diodes for use in high frequency resonant rectifiers at modest power levels. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several leading edge diodes for use in a 27.12 MHz Class-D type rectifier for output voltages from 170 V to 1000 V dc, and corresponding power levels between 8.5 W and 100 W. The authors suspect these losses are due in part to the high equation experienced by the Silicon Carbide (SiC) Schottky diodes used in that design.</description>
