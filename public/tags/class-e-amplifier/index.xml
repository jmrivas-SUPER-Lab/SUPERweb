      <description>In this paper, we present an alternative approach to designing a high-efficiency high power RF amplifier system. Here, we offer a simple tuning method that allows output powers from multiple power amplifiers to be combined directly without the need for an extra combiner network, given that the mismatches between the amplifiers are sufficiently small.</description>

      <description>we demonstrate a printed circuit board (PCB)-based WPT circuit operating at 40.68 MHz, utilizing no discrete inductors other than the WPT coils themselves and weighing only 7 g. This article describes the design methodology as well as the procedure to eliminate the discrete resonant inductors used in the implementation of our designs.</description>

      <title>On the Optimization of a Class-E Power Amplifier With GaN HEMTs at Megahertz Operation</title>

      <description>We examine the constraints that dictate when this optimization equations can and cannot be used, as well as propose a distributed loss model for the C oss loss based on a generalized Steinmetz equation (GSE) to allow this new loss term to be easily simulated. To verify our mathematical analysis and to demonstrate the applications of the proposed GSE-based C oss loss model, two design examples are provided.</description>
