      <title>Optimized Resonators for Piezoelectric Power Conversion</title>

      <description>The performance of inductors at high frequencies and small sizes is one of the largest limiting factors in the continued miniaturization of dc-dc converters. Piezoelectric resonators can have a very high quality factor and provide an inductive impedance between their series and parallel resonant frequencies, making them a promising technology for further miniaturizing dc-dc converters.</description>

      <title>Small- and Large-Signal Dynamic Output Capacitance and Energy Loss in GaN-on-Si Power HEMTs</title>

      <description>The origin of ${C}_{{\mathrm {oss}}}$ and the energy dissipation due to output capacitance can be roughly separated into two types: resistive loss and capacitive hysteresis loss. The resistive losses are due to the resistance of gallium nitride (GaN) buffer layers and Si-substrate.</description>

      <title>Origins of Soft-switching Coss Losses in SiC Power MOSFETs and Diodes for Resonant Converter Applications</title>

      <description>The recent development and commercialization of wide bandgap (WBG) power semiconductors, specifically gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC), has driven the increase in switching frequency for soft-switching power converters like the Class E, Class Φ2, and Class DE resonant inverters and rectifiers. However, prior literature has characterized numerous commercial GaN and SiC devices using the Sawyer-Tower circuit and discovered significant large-signal charge-voltage hysteresis of the Coss.</description>

      <title>Modular ON/OFF and Phase-Shifting for High-Speed Radio Frequency Power Modulation</title>

      <guid>/publication/modular-onoff-phaseshift-rfpm_north/</guid>
      <description>In this paper, we present an alternative power modulation method to create a high-efficiency high-speed RF amplifier system. This control technique utilizes two mechanisms, modular on/off and phase-shifting. In modular on/off, a different number of sub-circuits are turned “on” or “off” to crudely adjust the output power.</description>

      <title>Time and voltage domain load models for appliance-level grid edge simulation and control</title>
      <link>/publication/tandv-load-models-grid_goldin/</link>

      <description>Developments in simulation and distributed control of distributed energy resources require increasingly granular characterization and modeling of load behavior. Previous work has demonstrated the viability of voltage-based power control of residential appliances to enable load flexibility without service interruption. However, conventional static and dynamic load models fail to capture the coupled voltage and state dynamics relevant for this type of control.</description>

      <title>6.78-MHz Wireless Power Transfer With Self-Resonant Coils at 95% DC–DC Efficiency</title>
      <link>/publication/6m78-wpt-src-dcdc_gu/</link>

      <description>This letter describes the design considerations for inductive wireless power transfer systems operating at 6.78 MHz. With a novel high-frequency resonant amplifier topology, a high-Q self-resonant coil structure, and a better understanding of C oss losses in wide-bandgap power semiconductors, we demonstrate 6.78- MHz wireless power transfer systems that achieve 95% dc-dc efficiency at power levels up to and beyond 1 kW.</description>

      <title>A Simple Method to Combine the Output Power from Multiple Class-E Power Amplifiers</title>

      <description>In this paper, we present an alternative approach to designing a high-efficiency high power RF amplifier system. Here, we offer a simple tuning method that allows output powers from multiple power amplifiers to be combined directly without the need for an extra combiner network, given that the mismatches between the amplifiers are sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Multi-MHz Switching Frequencies on Dynamic On-Resistance in GaN-on-Si HEMTs</title>

      <guid>/publication/impact-mhz-dynamicrdson_zulauf/</guid>
      <description>Dynamic on-resistance (dRon), where the on-resistance immediately after turn-on is higher than the DC resistance, increases the conduction losses in power converters with gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs). There exist no direct dR on measurements in the literature above 1 MHz, leaving designers unable to predict conduction losses in emerging multi-MHz applications. We address this literature gap by collecting the first on-state voltage dR on measurements at multi-MHz frequencies, with a focus on the zero-voltage-switching conditions that are predominantly employed at high frequency. On the selected commercially-available HEMT with a breakdown voltage below 200 V, the dynamic contribution asymptotes above ≈ 2 MHz, a finding predicted by the slow time constants of the traps that cause dR on</description>

      <title>Lightweight High Voltage Generator for Untethered Electroadhesive Perching of Micro Air Vehicles</title>
      <link>/publication/hv-untethered-perching_park/</link>

      <guid>/publication/hv-untethered-perching_park/</guid>
      <description>In this letter, we motivate the need for application-specific power electronics solutions for electroadhesive perching, develop a useful figure of merit (the “specific voltage”) for comparing and guiding efforts, and walk through the design methodology of a system implementation. We conclude by showing that this high voltage power supply enables, for the first time in the literature, tetherless electroadhesive perching of a commercial micro quadrotor.</description>

      <description>This article presents the design and optimization of a suitable topology for an isolated dc–dc auxiliary power supply with high isolation voltage and low coupling capacitance. The converter consists of a GaN HEMT inverter operating at 6.78 MHz, an LCC resonance tank, and a class-E low dv/dt rectifier.</description>

      <title>Push–Pull Class Φ2  RF Power Amplifier</title>
      <link>/publication/ppphi2pa_gu/</link>

      <guid>/publication/ppphi2pa_gu/</guid>
      <description>This work focuses on improving the design and operating characteristics of a push–pull $\Phi _\text2$ amplifier with a $T$ network connected between the switch nodes, or a PPT $\Phi _\text2$ amplifier. The PPT $\Phi _\text2$ amplifier has less circulating energy and achieves higher cutoff frequency &lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; than other $\Phi _\text2$/EF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; circuits</description>
