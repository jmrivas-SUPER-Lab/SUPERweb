Thanks for stopping by!

I am an Associate Professor in the [Electrical Engineering Department at Stanford University](https://ee.stanford.edu/). 
My research interests are broadly in circuits, but more specifically in power electronics, resonant converters, gate drives, high-frequency passive components, Wide Bandgap devices, and finding new applications for power converters.

I joined Stanford in 2014 after serving two years as an Assistant Professor in the EECS department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. From 2007 to 2011 I worked as a senior power electronics engineering at the GE Global Research Center at Niskayuna, NY, where I work developing MRI compatible switched-mode power supplies, solar inverters, and in many other power electronics projects.
