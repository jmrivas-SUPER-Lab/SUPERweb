description: I am an Associate Professor in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I joined Stanford in 2014 after serving two years as an Assistant Professor in the EECS department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. From 2007 to 2011 I worked as a senior power electronics engineering at the GE Global Research Center at Niskayuna, NY, where I work developing MRI compatible switched-mode power supplies, solar inverters, and in many other power electronics projects. I got my undergraduate degree from the Monterrey Institute of Technology, Mexico City (1998), and the M.S. (2003) and Sc.D.  (2006) from MIT. My research interests include power electronics, resonant converters, resonant gate drive techniques, high-frequency magnetics, and finding new applications for power converters.
