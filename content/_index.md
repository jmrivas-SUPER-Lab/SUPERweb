  Thanks for stopping by!  
  My lab is the Stanford University Power Electronics Research Laboratory (SUPER-Lab), and we work in high frequency power electronics.
  My research interests are broadly in circuits, power electronics, resonant converters, gate drives, high-frequency passive components, Wide Bandgap devices, and finding new applications for converters.  
  
  I joined Stanford in 2014 after serving two years as an Assistant Professor in the EECS department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. From 2007 to 2011 I worked as a senior power electronics engineering at the GE Global Research Center at Niskayuna, NY, where I work developing MRI compatible switched-mode power supplies, solar inverters, and in many other power electronics projects.
