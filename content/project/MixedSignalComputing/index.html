<h1>Mixed-signal computing for online optimization of power electronics systems</h1>
<p>Online optimization and optimal control techniques can substantially improve the efficiency, performance, and reliability of many power electronics systems. Some examples include model predictive direct torque control for motor drives, maximum power point tracking for renewable energy applications, and the optimal power flow problem for electric grids. Moreover, there are emerging trends towards increasingly advanced optimization techniques based on machine learning and artificial intelligence that can provide further benefit to many applications. However, existing implementations of these optimization and optimal control techniques suffer from two key drawbacks: 1) they are too computationally complex to run in real-time, and 2) their high computation complexity necessitates digital microcontrollers/computers that can draw substantial amounts of power. These drawbacks limit the applicability and widespread adoption of such techniques, particularly in power and energy applications, where cost and energy efficiency are important considerations. This project explores a new mixed-signal computing platform for solving online optimization problems for power electronics systems in a fast and energy-efficient manner. Our results to date have demonstrated up to 100X improvements in speed and power consumption compared to previously published methods for comparable applications.</p>
