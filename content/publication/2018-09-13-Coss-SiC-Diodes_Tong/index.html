abstract: "Among HF/VHF rectifiers, SiC Schottky diodes exhibit larger losses compared to those captured in simulation, with additional off-state losses stemming from energy dissipation during the charging and discharging of the CJ. Because these losses are not included in manufacturer simulation models nor have they been well-studied for SiC Schottky diodes, we experimentally measured them using the Sawyer-Tower circuit and compared the losses across manufacturer, current rating, generation, voltage rating, and packaging. Furthermore, we analyzed the performances of these devices on a class-DE rectifier and compared their power dissipation from the simulation and experimental measurements."

<p>Among HF/VHF rectifiers, SiC Schottky diodes exhibit larger losses compared to those captured in simulation, with additional off-state losses stemming from energy dissipation during the charging and discharging of the CJ. Because these losses are not included in manufacturer simulation models nor have they been well-studied for SiC Schottky diodes, we experimentally measured them using the Sawyer-Tower circuit and compared the losses across manufacturer, current rating, generation, voltage rating, and packaging. Furthermore, we analyzed the performances of these devices on a class-DE rectifier and compared their power dissipation from the simulation and experimental measurements.</p>
