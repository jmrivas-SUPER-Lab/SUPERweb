abstract: "This paper presents the design and implementation of a high frequency switching power converter with a large voltage gain and air core inductors. Specifically, we demonstrate a 40 W, 30 V to 300 V dc-dc converter switching at 27.12 MHz. Operating at this frequency reduces bulk energy storage over conventional low frequency designs and allows for fast transient response. We implement a resonant converter based on the Φ 2 inverter of [1]. In this paper, we evaluate and compare two rectifier topologies with lower voltage stress than the class E rectifiers described in [2], to get large voltage ratios. Unique to this design is the ability to provide short bursts of high voltage while promising excellent performance and high power density."

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This paper presents the design and implementation of a high frequency switching power converter with a large voltage gain and air core inductors. Specifically, we demonstrate a 40 W, 30 V to 300 V dc-dc converter switching at 27.12 MHz. Operating at this frequency reduces bulk energy storage over conventional low frequency designs and allows for fast transient response. We implement a resonant converter based on the Φ 2 inverter of [1]. In this paper, we evaluate and compare two rectifier topologies with lower voltage stress than the class E rectifiers described in [2], to get large voltage ratios. Unique to this design is the ability to provide short bursts of high voltage while promising excellent performance and high power density.</p>
