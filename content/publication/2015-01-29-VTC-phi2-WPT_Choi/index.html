abstract: "This paper presents the design and implementation of high frequency resonant converter based on the Class Φ 2 inverter for inductive power transfer. MHz frequency operation can allow for higher power density than conventional switching frequencies. The converter is based on the Class Φ 2 inverter, reducing the voltage stress across the switch compared to other resonant topologies. A prototype of converter and a few cm airgap inductive coupling system with resistive load was implemented. We will demonstrate a greater than hundred Watt push-pull resonant converter for inductive power transfer at 13.56MHz."
