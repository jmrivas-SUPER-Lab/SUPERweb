## Abstract 

This article presents a carrier phase shifting technique for minimizing the aggregate harmonics in networks of asymmetric parallel-connected inverters for distributed power generation system applications. The proposed technique is: 1) implemented in a decentralized manner, relying only on local voltage and current measurements, and 2) optimal in the sense that it minimizes a cost function representing the carrier-frequency current harmonics. The analysis indicates that the proposed optimal carrier phase shifting technique can enable order-of-magnitude reductions in harmonic power, and also universal improvements compared to symmetric carrier interleaving for asymmetric inverter networks. Moreover, compared to existing methods that require either centralized communication or information exchange between inverters to coordinate carriers, the proposed technique is completely decentralized, which provides important practical benefits for implementation, including improved robustness and reduced cost. The technique is experimentally validated on a network of three single-phase 2-kW inverters and demonstrates a 36.5% reduction in the weighted total harmonic distortion factor of the aggregate inverter current, and the ability to converge to the optimal carrier phase spacing dynamically in less than one line frequency cycle (16.7 ms) in steady state and transient operating conditions.
